# Use WordPress Language Packs

The goal of this plugin is to make it possible to use the WordPress Language Packs for the locales in ClassicPress that aren't supported yet. As more locales become officially supported in ClassicPress, this plugin won't be necessary anymore.

## Installation


To **install Use WordPress Language Packs on a current ClassicPress site**

1. Download the
   [plugin zip file](https://github.com/ClassicPress-research/use-wp-language-packs/archive/master.zip)
   from here on GitHub.
2. Install the downloaded zip file from within the ClassicPress dashboard 
   ("Plugins" -> "Add New" -> "Upload Plugin").
3. Activate this plugin ("Use WordPress Language Packs") after it is installed.
4. Go to the General Settings page and select the desired language from the Languages Dropdown.
5. Hit the save button and check if the language changed to the selected one.

**PLEASE NOTE:** When using this plugin, **most** but **not all** strings will be translated into the requested language! This is normal, expected behavior.
